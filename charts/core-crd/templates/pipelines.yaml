                        PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the

                                      Command is the command line to execute inside the container, the working directory for the
                                      command  is root ('/') in the container's filesystem. The command is simply exec'd, it is
                                      not run inside a shell, so traditional shell instructions ('|', etc) won't work. To use
                                      a shell, you need to explicitly call out to that shell.
                                      Exit status of 0 is treated as live/healthy and non-zero is unhealthy.

                              PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the

                              period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                              or until the termination grace period is reached.

                          When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                          between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                          The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                          or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                          labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                          In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                          | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                          |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                          - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                          scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                          violate MaxSkew(1).
                          - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                          When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                          to topologies that satisfy it.

                          MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                          When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                          Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                          And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                          this value has no effect on scheduling.
                          As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                          scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                          If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                          Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                          When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                          labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:

                          TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key
                          and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
                          We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                          of pods into each bucket.

                          nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                          e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.

                          - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
                          - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
                            but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                            skew.
                          A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                          if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                          "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                          labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
                          | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                          | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                          If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                          to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                          MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                          won't make it *more* imbalanced.
