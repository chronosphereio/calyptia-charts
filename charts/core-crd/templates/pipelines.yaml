                        preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                        container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                        PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                        container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                        period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                        or until the termination grace period is reached.

                              preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                              container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                              PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                              container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                              period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                              or until the termination grace period is reached.

                          MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                          When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                          between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                          The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                          or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                          labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                          In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                          | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                          |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                          - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                          scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                          violate MaxSkew(1).
                          - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                          When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                          to topologies that satisfy it.

                          MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                          When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                          Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                          And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                          this value has no effect on scheduling.
                          As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                          scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                          If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                          Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                          When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                          labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                          | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                          |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                          The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                          In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                          because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                          it will violate MaxSkew.

                          - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
                            but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                            skew.
                          A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                          if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                          "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                          labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
                          | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                          | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                          If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                          to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                          MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                          won't make it *more* imbalanced.

                                    Setting this to "Proxy" indicates that traffic is delivered to the node or pod with
                                    the destination set to the node's IP and node port or the pod's IP and port.
